# My config files
These are my configuration files for vim, gvim, neovim, bash and such.

## Installing Plugins
Change the route of plugins inside **plug#begin()** depending on where they are saved.

### Vim
Since vimrc is using *junegunn's vim-plug*, use `:PlugInstall` to install the plugins.

### Neovim
For Neovim, you should also run `:PackerSync`.
